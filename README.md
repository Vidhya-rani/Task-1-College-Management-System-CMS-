Project Overview
The College Management System (CMS) is a software application developed to manage and organise academic and administrative activities within a college. The system helps in maintaining student records, course details, attendance, examinations, and marks in a centralised and structured manner. It replaces manual processes with a digital platform to improve efficiency and accuracy.
The system is designed to provide role-based access for Admin, Teacher, and Student. The admin manages overall system data, Teachers handle academic activities like attendance and marks, and Students can view their academic information.

Objectives
The main objectives of the College Management System are:
•	To manage student, teacher, and course information in one system.
•	To reduce manual paperwork and human errors.
•	To maintain student attendance and marks records.
•	To provide a secure login for Admin, Teacher, and Students.
•	To make academic information easily accessible.

Scope
The scope of the College Management System includes:
•	Managing student admission and personal details.
•	Managing teacher information and assigned courses.
•	Recording attendance and examination marks.
•	Allowing students to view attendance and results.
•	Storing all data in a centralised database.
The system does not include advanced features such as online learning modules or external integrations.

Finalisation (Day 1 Summary)
On Day 1, the project overview, objectives, and scope of the College Management System were defined and finalised. The system roles and major functionalities were clearly identified to ensure proper planning for further development.
 
Day 2 – Requirement Analysis

Requirement Analysis Overview
Requirement analysis defines what the system should do and how it should behave.
It helps in clearly understanding the features and limitations of the College Management System before designing or implementing it.
The requirements are divided into:
•	Functional Requirements
•	Non-Functional Requirements

Functional Requirements
(What the system should do)
•	The system should allow Admin, Teacher, and Student to log in securely.
•	The admin should manage student details such as name, age, email, phone number, joining date, and course information.
•	The admin should manage teacher and course records.
•	The Teacher should mark attendance for students.
•	The Teacher should enter and update student marks.
•	The student should view attendance records.
•	The student should view the marks summary and course details.
•	The system should store all academic data in a structured database.

Non-Functional Requirements
(How the system should perform)
•	The system should allow access only to authorised users.
•	The system should store data securely and prevent unauthorised modifications.
•	The system should respond quickly when users perform actions.
•	The system should support multiple users simultaneously.
•	The system should maintain accurate and consistent data.
•	The system should be available without frequent downtime.

 
Day 2 Summary (You Can Use This in the Report)
On Day 2, the functional and non-functional requirements of the College Management System were identified and documented. The system features for Admin, Teacher, and Student were clearly defined to ensure proper system design and implementation in the next phase.
Day 3: User Roles & Module Finalisation

 User Roles
The College Management System includes three main user roles: Admin, Teacher, and Student. Each role has specific responsibilities and access permissions within the system.
Admin
The admin has full access to the system. The admin is responsible for managing overall system data and operations.
Admin can:
•	Add, update, and delete student records.
•	Add, update, and delete teacher records.
•	Manage course details.

 Module Finalisation
The College Management System is divided into the following modules:
 User Management Module
Handles login and role-based access control.
 Student Management Module
Manages student admission details and personal information.
 Course Management Module
Manages course information and teacher assignments.
 Attendance Management Module
Allows teachers to record and manage student attendance.
 Examination & Marks Module
Allows teachers to enter marks and students to view results.
Day 3 Summary:
      On Day 3, the user roles of the College Management System were clearly defined. The responsibilities and access levels of Admin, Teacher, and Student were finalised to ensure proper role-based control. The main system modules, such as User Management, Student Management, Course Management, Attendance Management, and Examination & Marks Management, were identified and structured to organize system functionality effectively.

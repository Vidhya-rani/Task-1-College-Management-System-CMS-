Day 1:

Project Overview
The College Management System (CMS) is a software application developed to manage and organise academic and administrative activities within a college. The system helps in maintaining student records, course details, attendance, examinations, and marks in a centralised and structured manner. It replaces manual processes with a digital platform to improve efficiency and accuracy.
The system is designed to provide role-based access for Admin, Teacher, and Student. The admin manages overall system data, Teachers handle academic activities like attendance and marks, and Students can view their academic information.

 Finalisation (Day 1 Summary)
On Day 1, the project overview, objectives, and scope of the College Management System were defined and finalised. The system roles and major functionalities were clearly identified to ensure proper planning for further development.



Day 2 – Requirement Analysis
________________________________________
 Requirement Analysis Overview
Requirement analysis defines what the system should do and how it should behave.
It helps in clearly understanding the features and limitations of the College Management System before designing or implementing it.
The requirements are divided into:
•	Functional Requirements
•	Non-Functional Requirements
________________________________________
 Functional Requirements  
        (What the system should do)
•	The system should allow Admin, Teacher, and Student to log in securely.
•	The admin should manage student details such as name, age, email, phone number, joining date, and course information.
